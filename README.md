# DevOps-Engineer-onboarding
## Guiding thoughts
**Take time to learn.** Don't get sucked into the minutia of decision-making or project involvement too early - there will be plenty of time for that later. In your first 30 days, try to focus on getting comfortable and learning how things work. Try to learn Linux basic, bash scripts and etc.

**Invest in relationships.** By day 60, you'll be in execution mode. In your first two months, spend as much time as you can getting to know people and forming relationships. So, try to learn Git, docker and bash advanced, which are nessesary tools for DevOps engineers. 

## 90-day milestones
After that, you need to get some experience with sql db sush as postgresql and mysql, with web-server Nginx and Kubernetes basic and ,of course, CI/CD. I've put together this onboarding plan to help you get up to speed in your new role as a DevOps Engineer on DevOps team. 

**Don't be afraid to ask.** No one expects you to know how things at Area0 work right away. Take advantage of that and ask for help when you need it. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions. <br />
