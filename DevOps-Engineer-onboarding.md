# DevOps-Engineer-onboarding
## Guiding thoughts
**Take time to learn.** Don't get sucked into the minutia of decision-making or project involvement too early - there will be plenty of time for that later. In your first 30 days, try to focus on getting comfortable and learning how things work.

**Invest in relationships.** By day 60, you'll be in execution mode. In your first two months, spend as much time as you can getting to know people and forming relationships.

**Don't be afraid to ask.** No one expects you to know how things at Area0 work right away. Take advantage of that and ask for help when you need it.
## 90-day milestones
I've put together this onboarding plan to help you get up to speed in your new role as a DevOps Engineer on DevOps team. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions  â€‹
